## Overview
Do you often find yourself gazing into the void of your terminal,  
wondering if your computer has decided to take a coffee break without notifying you?

100+ predefined animations

- [Spinner](https://docs.rs/zenity/latest/zenity/spinner/frames/struct.Frames.html)
- [ProgressBar](https://docs.rs/zenity/latest/zenity/progress/frames/struct.Frames.html)

## How to Use?

It's as easy as pie (or maybe even easier, depending on your pie-making skills)!  
Follow these steps:

````shell
cargo add zenity
````

```rust
// example/basic.rs

use std::thread::sleep;
use std::time::Duration;
use zenity::spinner::MultiSpinner;

fn main() {
    // create a LoadingAnimation instance using one of the predefined animations
    let spinner = MultiSpinner::default();
    sleep(Duration::from_secs(5));

    // optional:
    // set the text to "Loading..."
    spinner.set_text(&spinner.get_last(), "  Loading...".to_string());

    sleep(Duration::from_secs(500));
    // `loading_animation` will run out of scope now and get dropped,
    // thus the animation will stop and remove itself from the console
}
```
